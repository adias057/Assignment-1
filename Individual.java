/**
 * An <code>Individual</code> (a chromosome) is a candidate solution for a given
 * problem. Its representation depends on the specific problem to be solved. Two
 * individuals can be combined (see method crossover) to produce a new
 * offspring. As with natural chromosomes, these artificial ones suffer
 * mutations. Each chromosome has a fitness value that indicates the quality of
 * this solution.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * A <code>Population</code> is a collection of chromosomes. At each iteration
 * (generation), the genetic algorithm selects chromosomes for reproduction. The
 * offsprings are inserted into the population, and the least fitted individuals
 * are eliminated. Thus, the size of the population is fixed.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * For this assignment, an <code>Individual</code> represents a solution to the
 * <code>n</code>-Queens problem. As introduced in the assignment description, a
 * candidate solution is represented by a permutation of size <code>n</code>,
 * such that attribute <code>i</code> represents the row for the queen found at
 * column <code>i</code>.
 * <p/>
 * 
 * Not all permutations are valid solutions to <code>n</code>-Queens problem. A
 * permutation is a valid solution if no two queens can attack each other. Two
 * queens are attacking each other if they are on the same row or column, which
 * is impossible given this representation, but also if they are found on the
 * same minor or major diagonal.
 * <p/>
 *
 * Herein, we define the fitness value of an individual as the number of pairs
 * of queens attacking each other.
 * <p/>
 * You must complete the implementation of the class <code>Individual</code>
 * following all the directives.
